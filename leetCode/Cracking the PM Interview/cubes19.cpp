// Design an algorithm and write code to find all solutions to the equation a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3 where a, b, c, and d are positive integers less than 1000. If you wish, you can print only "interesting" solutions. That is, you can ignore solutions of the form x^3 + y^3 = x^3 + y^3 and solutions that are simple permutations of other solutions (swipping left and right hand sides, swapping a and b, swapping c and d). FOr example, if you were printing all solutions less than 20, you could choose to print ony 2^3 + 16^3 = 9^3 + 15^3 and 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3
