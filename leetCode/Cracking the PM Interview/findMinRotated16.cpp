// 16.16
// You are given an integer array which was sorted, but then rotated. It contains all distinct elements. Find the minimum value.
// For example, the array might be 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 20, 3, 4, 5
//      The minimum value would obviously be 3.


// could add more parameters, or could use while loop
